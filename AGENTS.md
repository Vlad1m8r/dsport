# AGENTS Instructions

## Scope
These guidelines apply to the entire repository unless a nested `AGENTS.md` overrides them.

## About `AGENTS.md`
`AGENTS.md` files describe workflow expectations for contributors. They are scoped to their directory tree, so deeper files take precedence when instructions conflict. Treat them as living documentation and keep guidance concise and actionable.

## Repository Conventions
- Follow standard Java formatting (e.g., Google Java Style) when editing source under `src/`.
- Prefer descriptive commit messages and keep commits focused on a single concern.
- Run `./mvnw test` before finishing substantial changes and include the command in your final report when executed.
- Document notable behavior changes in your summary and note any required follow-up work.
